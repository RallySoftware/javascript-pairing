# Javascript Pairing Interview

### Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/rallysoftware/javascript-pairing
cd javascript-pairing
npm i
npm run test:watch
```

This will clone the repo, move you into the project directory, install the dependencies and start watching your code and running tests in the background.

After you select an exercise replace `describe` with `describe.only` to focus on that specific test and reduce console output.
